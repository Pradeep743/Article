    <h2>What is Photosynthesis ?</h2>

    <p>
      Photosynthesis is a life process powered by the sun. Directly or
      indirectly through the food chain, it fuels most life on Earth.
      Photosynthesis is carried out by green plants and some type of algae as
      well as by cyanobacteria and related organisms, which are responsible for
      most of the photosynthesis in oceans.

    <h2>The Lichen Partnership</h2>

    <p>
      A lichen may resemble a single plant-like organism, but it is really a
      colony of algae embedded in a matrix formed by the filaments of a fungus -
      a good example of

    </p>
    <p>
      The partnership between algae and fungi benefits from the combination of
      two different methods of getting food for energy. The algae in lichens
      make food through photosynthesis, while the fungi absorb food and water
      from their environment. With both methods available to it, a lichen can
      survive in challenging habitats such as rocks or snow.
