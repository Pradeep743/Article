      <h2># What is Photosynthesis ?</h2>

      <p>
        Photosynthesis is a life process powered by the sun. Directly or
        indirectly through the food chain, it fuels most life on Earth.
        Photosynthesis is carried out by green plants and some type of algae as
        well as by cyanobacteria and related organisms, which are responsible
        for most of the photosynthesis in oceans.

      <h2># The Lichen Partnership</h2>

      <p>
        A lichen may resemble a single plant-like organism, but it is really a
        colony of algae embedded in a matrix formed by the filaments of a fungus
        - a good example of
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/symbiosis">symbiosis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partnership between algae and fungi benefits from the combination of
        two different methods of getting food for energy. The algae in lichens
        make food through photosynthesis, while the fungi absorb food and water
        from their environment. With both methods available to it, a lichen can
        survive in challenging habitats such as rocks or snow.

      <h2># What is Phototropism ?</h2>

      <p>
        Many plants, and some other organisms such as fungi, exhibit a tendency
        to grow toward a light source. This process is known as "Phototropism".
        Plant's responses also vary according to the wavelength of the light to
        which they are exposed, with red light often evoking the strongest
        response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant harmones called auxins trigger cellular changes and swelling
        inside the plant, causing it to move toward the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shoots of some vines may purposefully grow away from the light. They
        seek instead dark solid objects to climb, this process is called
        "Negative Phototropism".

      <h2># What is Pollination ?</h2>
      <img

        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        The essential reproductive act in plant world is pollination: the
        distribution of male reproductive cells in the form of pollen to join
        with female reproductive cells in the ovary, deep within a plant's
        flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pollination often involves a partnership between a flowering plant and
        an animal that carries the pollen on its body. Insects are the most
        frequent pollinators, but birds, butterflies, reptiles, and even mammals
        such as bats participate.

      <h2># Why do leaves change color ?</h2>
      <img src="https://www.elitetreecare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/autum-leaves.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        As days grow shorter and temperatures cooler, decidous trees prepare for
        winter dormancy. Lacking sufficient light and water, photosynthesis
        shuts down, and trees must live off food stored during the growing
        season.
      </p>
      <p>
        In spring, leaves lay the groundwork for their demise. A special layer
        of cells forms at the base of each leaf, called the abscission and
        separation layer. Its work is to transport water to the leaf adn take
        food, created by photosynthesis, back to the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        In autumn, the cells of this layer begin to swell and the bottom of this
        layer forms a corklike substance that eventually cuts off all transfer
        between leaf and tree. Meanwhile, the top of the layer begins to
        disintegrate, making it easy for the leaf to detach.
