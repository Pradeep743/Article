    <p>
      Photosynthesis is a life process powered by the sun. Directly or
      indirectly through the food chain, it fuels most life on Earth.
      Photosynthesis is carried out by green plants and some type of algae as
      well as by cyanobacteria and related organisms, which are responsible for
      most of the photosynthesis in oceans.
