      <h2># What is Photosynthesis ?</h2>

      <p>
        Photosynthesis is a life process powered by the sun. Directly or
        indirectly through the food chain, it fuels most life on Earth.
        Photosynthesis is carried out by green plants and some type of algae as
        well as by cyanobacteria and related organisms, which are responsible
        for most of the photosynthesis in oceans.

        A lichen may resemble a single plant-like organism, but it is really a
        colony of algae embedded in a matrix formed by the filaments of a fungus
        - a good example of
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/symbiosis" target="_blank"
          >symbiosis</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partnership between algae and fungi benefits from the combination of
        two different methods of getting food for energy. The algae in lichens
        make food through photosynthesis, while the fungi absorb food and water
        from their environment. With both methods available to it, a lichen can
        survive in challenging habitats such as rocks or snow.

      <h2># What is Phototropism ?</h2>

        alt="Phototropism"
      />
      <p>
        Many plants, and some other organisms such as fungi, exhibit a tendency
        to grow toward a light source. This process is known as "Phototropism".
        Plant's responses also vary according to the wavelength of the light to
        which they are exposed, with red light often evoking the strongest
        response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant harmones called auxins trigger cellular changes and swelling
        inside the plant, causing it to move toward the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shoots of some vines may purposefully grow away from the light. They
        seek instead dark solid objects to climb, this process is called
        "Negative Phototropism".

      <h2># What is Pollination ?</h2>

        alt="Pollination"
      />
      <p>
        The essential reproductive act in plant world is pollination: the
        distribution of male reproductive cells in the form of pollen to join
        with female reproductive cells in the ovary, deep within a plant's
        flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pollination often involves a partnership between a flowering plant and
        an animal that carries the pollen on its body. Insects are the most
        frequent pollinators, but birds, butterflies, reptiles, and even mammals
        such as bats participate.

      <h2># Why do leaves change color ?</h2>
      <img

        alt="Trees in autumn season"
      />
      <p>
        As days grow shorter and temperatures cooler, decidous trees prepare for
        winter dormancy. Lacking sufficient light and water, photosynthesis
        shuts down, and trees must live off food stored during the growing
        season.
      </p>
      <p>
        In spring, leaves lay the groundwork for their demise. A special layer
        of cells forms at the base of each leaf, called the abscission and
        separation layer. Its work is to transport water to the leaf adn take
        food, created by photosynthesis, back to the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        In autumn, the cells of this layer begin to swell and the bottom of this
        layer forms a corklike substance that eventually cuts off all transfer
        between leaf and tree. Meanwhile, the top of the layer begins to
        disintegrate, making it easy for the leaf to detach.

      <h2># Plants that prey on Animals</h2>

      <p>
        Some plants that live in areas poor in nutrients or sunshine get energy
        in other ways. Carnivorous plants live, at least part of the time, off
        the nutrition they ingest from the insects they lure and devour. These
        carnivores are more specifically insectivores, and they often live in
        bogs and swamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of more than 600 known insectivorous plants,
        <em>the Venus flytrap</em> is common to swamps in North and South
        Carolina.The plant's hinged leaves form traps that snap shut on insects
        alighting there. Other insectivores include

        The Austrlian Christmas Tree <br /><span>
          grows haustoria - or root parts - that draw nutrients from host
          plants. Like other parasitic plants it doesn't rely on
          photosynthesis.</span
        >
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        Parasitic plants commandeer the resources of other plants. Some tap into
        the root systems of other plants; some attach directly into trunks or
        branches. Many do not even photosynthesize, relying on the host plant
        for all their nutrition. Dodder, an aggressive parasitic vine, has
        miniscule leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other plants, known as hemiparasites, do photosynthesize but still take
        nutrients from host plants. Members of the mistletoe family belong to
        this category.

      <p>
        A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that enters animal, plant, or
        bacteria hosts. A single virus particle, called a virion, is little more
        than a bundle of genetic material - DNA or RNA - that does not take the
        form of a cell. Instead it is encased in a shell called a viral coat, or
        capsid, made of bits of protein. Some viruses have an additional
        enclosure around the capsid called an envelope.

      <p>
        Most insects descend from long, hardy lineages. One of the most durable
        is the cockroach, which has changed very little in more than 300 million
        years. Fossils from the Paleozoic era include cockroaches virtually
        identical in shape and size to today's pests. One coal mine in eastern
        Ohio contained fossil specimens not only of cockroaches with three-inch
        wings but also of centipedes, millipedes, and spiders.

      <p>
        Moths and butterflies undergo a maturational transformation so
        remarkable it has become the stuff of myth and poetry around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        A butterfly begins as an egg. Soon the larva - a caterpillar - bites
        through the egg and exits. It consumes its former shell and goes on to
        feed on leaves and shed its skin several times. Then it attaches itself
        to a twig or other object and enters the pupal stage when it forms a
        chrysalis. Inside, the caterpillar's body re-forms as a butterfly. When
        the transformation is complete, the adult butterfly crawls out of the
        chrysalis and flexes its wings to pump blood into them. With wings firm
        and dry, it flies away.

        A close relative of the spider - and not a crab at all - the horseshoe
        crab bears a long lineage. Vestiges of similar animals date back 200
        million years. Horseshoe crabs have hinged bodies, a horshoe-shaped
        head, and a long tail-spine. They can grow up to two feet long. They
        live on the east coasts of Asia and North America.

        Betta splendens, <span>also known as "Siamese fighting fish"</span>
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        Most fish breathe with gills, arched structures on either side of the
        body that contain features known as filaments and lamellae. Water which
        contains oxygen, flows in through the fish's open mouth and then out
        across the gills. Rakers filter out particles as the water flows
        through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blood coursing through the filaments and lamellae delivers oxygen into
        the bloodstream. The filaments and lamellae also dump carbon dioxide
        from the body into the gills, and water carries it out of the body.

        Many animals have developed defensive features, but the bombardier
        beetle packs a wallop unlike any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just half an inch in length, these insects live under rocks and logs and
        feed on the larvae of moths and other insects. When disturbed, they
        blast out irritating chemicals from their flexible abdomens. They
        produce the irritant as needed, mixing hydrogen peroxide and phenols in
        an enzyme chamber, where oxidation produces heat and an explosive pop.

      <h2># How do Snowflakes form?</h2>
      <p>Snowflakes start as ice crystals that form high in the atmosphere, when water vapour either condenses around a solid nucleus or, under even colder conditions, freezes directly in a process called sublimation. The flakes, typically hexagonal, are infinite in design. Their individuality depends on the temperature and pressure at which freezing occurs.</p>
